Changes in version 1.0-14 (12/02/2014) 
    * arsa.f: removed 0 flag in rand() so it compiles under AIX 
      (reported by Lei Zhang)
    * arsa.f/bburg.f/bbwrg.f: calls now R RNG to be compatible with certain 
	    compilers (e.g., Intel FORTRAN) (reported by Rohan Shah)

Changes in version 1.0-13 (3/11/2014) 
    * Fixed dependence on MASS

Changes in version 1.0-12 (2/18/14)

    * get_order: removed the weird labels. 
    * we use now testthat
    * fixed bug with intra-cluster ordering using silhouette width 
	    (reported by Bettina Gruen)
    * Cleaned up dependencies: TSP, grid, cluster, gclus and colorspace are
	    now imports instead of dependencies.

Changes in version 1.0-11 (9/6/13)
    * service release.

Changes in version 1.0-10 (2/15/13)

	    (Bug report by G. Sawitzki).
    * bertinplot(): added panel.blocks and option for shading
    * bertinplot(): added bertin_cut_line()

Changes in version 1.0-4 (6/28/11)
    * pimage() now uses grid.raster.
    * dissplot() now uses grid.raster.

Changes in version 1.0-3 (1/14/11)
    * improved validity check for permutations and added check for dist with 
	    neg. entries to seriate.dist.

Changes in version 1.0-2 (3/13/10)
    * service release

Changes in version 1.0-1 (8/25/09)
    * added drop=FALSE in permute for matrix.
    * fixed reordering for labels.
    * added permute for character.
    * added different methods to calculate between cluster 
	    dissimilarities (min, max, avg, Hausdorff).
    * dissplot has now additional options hue, power, gamma, flip and 
	    changed behavior for averages. dissplot depends now on colorspace.
