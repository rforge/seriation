\details{
Seriation methods are available via a registry. 
See \code{\link{list_seriation_methods}} for help.

Many seriation methods (heuristically) optimize (minimize or maximize) 
an objective function.
The value of the function for a given seriation can be calculated using
\code{\link{criterion}}. In this manual page we only state the measure
which is optimized (using \bold{bold font}). 
A definition of the measures can be found in the
\code{\link{criterion}} manual page.
  
Two-way two-mode data has to be provided as a dist object (not as a symmetric
matrix). Similarities have to be transformed in a suitable way into
dissimilarities. Currently the following methods are implemented for dist:
   
\describe{    
\item{\code{"ARSA"}}{Anti-Robinson seriation by simulated annealing to minimize
  the \bold{unweighted gradient measure} (Brusco et al 2007).
    } 
\item{\code{"BBURCG"}}{Anti-Robinson seriation by branch-and-bound to minimize
  the \bold{unweighted gradient measure} (Brusco and Stahl 2005).
  This is only feasible for a 
  relatively small number of objects.
    } 
\item{\code{"BBWRCG"}}{Anti-Robinson seriation by branch-and-bound to minimize
  the \bold{weighted gradient measure} (Brusco and Stahl 2005). This is only feasible for a 
  relatively small number of objects.
    }

\item{\code{"TSP"}}{Traveling salesperson problem solver to minimize
      the \bold{Hamiltonian path length}.
      The solvers in \pkg{TSP} are used (see \code{solve_TSP}). 
      The solver method can be passed on via the
      \code{control} argument, e.g. \code{control = list(method = "2-opt")}.
      Default is the nearest insertion heuristic.

      Since a tour returned by a TSP solver is a connected circle and we are
      looking for a path representing a linear order, we need to find the best
      cutting point.  Climer and Zhang (2006) suggest to add a dummy city with
      equal distance to each other city before generating the tour. The place
      of this dummy city in an optimal tour with minimal length is the best
      cutting point (it lies between the most distant cities).} 

\item{\code{"R2E"} or \code{"Chen"}}{Rank-two ellipse seriation (Chen 2002).

        This method starts with generating a sequence of correlation matrices
      \eqn{R^1, R^2, \ldots}. \eqn{R^1} is the correlation matrix
      of the original distance matrix \eqn{D} (supplied to the function as 
      \code{x}), 
      and 
        \deqn{R^{n+1} = \phi R^n,} 
      where \eqn{\phi} calculates the
      correlation matrix. 
      
      The rank of the matrix \eqn{R^n} falls with increasing \eqn{n}. The 
      first \eqn{R^n} in the sequence which has a rank of 2 is found. 
      Projecting all points in this matrix on the first two eigenvectors,
      all points fall on an ellipse. The order of the points on this ellipse
      is the resulting order. 
      
      The ellipse can be cut at the two interception points 
      (top or bottom) of the vertical axis with the ellipse. 
      In this implementation the top most cutting point is used.
      }  

\item{\code{"MDS"}, \code{"MDS_metric"}, \code{"MDS_nonmetric"},
  \code{"MDS_angle"}}{Multidimensional scaling (MDS).

    Use multidimensional scaling techniques to find an linear order. Note 
    that unidimensional scaling would be more appropriate but is very hard to 
    solve. Generally, ordering along the first component of 
    MDS provides good results.

    By default, metric MDS (\code{cmdscale} in \pkg{stats}) is used. 
    In case of of general dissimilarities, non-metric MDS can be used.
    The choices are \code{isoMDS} and \code{sammon} from \pkg{MASS}.
    The method can be specified as the element \code{method} 
    (\code{"cmdscale"}, \code{"isoMDS"} or \code{"sammon"}) in \code{control}.
    
    For convenience, \code{"MDS_metric"} performs \code{cmdscale} and
    \code{"MDS_nonmetric"} performs \code{isoMDS}.
    
    \code{"MDS_angle"} projects the data on the first two components
    found by MDS and then orders by the angle in this space. The order
    is split by the larges gap between adjacent angles. A similar method was 
    used for ordering correlation matrices by Friendly (2002).
  
  }  
\item{\code{"HC"}, \code{"HC_single"}, \code{"HC_complete"}, \code{"HC_average"}}{Hierarchical clustering.

    Using the order of the leaf nodes in a dendrogram obtained by hierarchical
    clustering can be used as a very simple seriation technique.
    This method applies hierarchical clustering (\code{hclust}) to \code{x}. 
    The clustering method can be given using a \code{"method"} element in 
    the \code{control} list. If omitted, the default \code{"average"} is
    used.
    
    For convenience \code{"HC_single"}, \code{"HC_complete"} and 
    \code{"HC_average"} are provided.
    }
    

\item{\code{"GW"}, \code{"OLO"}}{Hierarchical 
    clustering (by default using average-link)
      with additional leaf-node reordering to minimize
    \bold{Hamiltonian path length}.

    A dendrogram (binary tree) has \eqn{2^{n-1}} internal nodes (subtrees) and
    the same number of leaf orderings. That is, at each internal node the left
    and right subtree (or leaves) can be swapped, or, in terms of a dendrogram,
    be flipped. 

    Method \code{"GW"} uses an algorithm developed by Gruvaeus and Wainer
(1972) and implemented in package \pkg{gclus} (Hurley 2004).  The clusters are
ordered at each level so that the objects at the edge of each cluster are
adjacent to that object outside the cluster to which it is nearest. The method
produces an unique order.

    Method \code{"OLO"} (Optimal leaf ordering, Bar-Joseph et al., 2001) 
produces an optimal leaf ordering with respect to the
minimizing the sum of the distances along the (Hamiltonian) path connecting the
leaves in the given order. The time complexity of the algorithm is \eqn{O(n^3)}.
Note that non-finite distance values are not allowed.

   Both methods start with a dendrogram created by \code{hclust}. As  the
\code{"method"} element in the \code{control} list a clustering method (default
\code{"average"}) can be specified. Alternatively, a \code{hclust} object can
be supplied using an element named \code{"hclust"}.
    }

  \item{\code{"VAT"}}{Visual Assessment of (Clustering) Tendency (Bezdek and Hathaway (2002)).

    Creates an order based on Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning
    tree (MST) in a weighted connected graph representing the distance matrix.
    The order is given by the order in which the nodes (objects) are added
    to the MST.
    }

\item{\code{"Spectral"}, \code{"Spectral_norm"}}{ Spectral seriation (Ding and He 2004). 

Spectral seriation uses a relaxation to maximize the \bold{Inertia criterion} by using the order of the Fielder vector of 
the similarity matrix's (normalized) Laplacian.  
  }
  
\item{\code{"SPIN_NH"}, \code{"SPIN_STS"}}{ Sorting Points Into Neighborhoods (SPIN) (Tsafrir 2005).
Given a weight matrix \eqn{W}, the algorithms try to minimize the energy for a permutation (matrix \eqn{P}) 
given by \deqn{F(P) = tr(PDP^TW),} where \eqn{tr} denotes the matrix 
trace.

\code{"SPIN_STS"} implements the Side-to-Side algorithm which tries
to push out large distance values. The default weight matrix
suggested in the paper with \eqn{W=XX^T} and \eqn{X_i=i-(n+1)/2} is used.
We run the algorithm from \code{step} (25) iteration and restart the
algorithm \code{nstart} (10) with random initial permutations (default values in parentheses). Via \code{control} the parameters \code{step}, \code{nstart},
\code{X} and \code{verbose}.

\code{"SPIN_NH"} implements the neighborhood algorithm (concentrate
low distance values around the diagonal) with a 
Gaussian weight matrix
\eqn{W_{ij} = exp(-(i-j)^2/n\sigma)}, where \eqn{n} is the size of the 
dissimilarity matrix and \eqn{\sigma} is the variance around the diagonal 
that control the influence
of global (large \eqn{\sigma}) or local (small \eqn{\sigma}) structure.

We use the heuristic suggested in the paper for the linear assignment problem.
We do not terminate as indicated in the algorithm, but run all the iterations since the heuristic does not guarantee that the energy is strictly decreasing.
We also implement the heuristic "annealing" scheme where \eqn{\sigma} is
successively reduced. The parameters in \code{control}
are \code{sigma} which can be a single value or a decreasing sequence 
(default: 20 to 1 in 10 steps) and \code{step} which defines how many update 
steps are performed before for each value of \code{alpha}.  
Via \code{W_function} a custom function to create \eqn{W} with the function
signature \code{function(n, sigma, verbose)} can be specified.
The parameter \code{verbose} can be used to display progress information. 
}

\item{\code{"Identity"}}{ Produces an identity permutation. }

\item{\code{"Random"}}{ Produces a random permutation. }
}

Two-way two mode data are general positive matrices.
Currently the following methods are implemented for matrix:
\describe{
\item{\code{"BEA"}}{Bond Energy Algorithm (BEA; McCormick 1972). 
     The algorithm tries to maximize the \bold{Measure of Effectiveness.}
     of a non-negative matrix. Due to the definition
     of this measure, the tasks of ordering rows and columns is separable
     and can  be solved independently.

     A row is arbitrarily placed; then rows are positioned one by one. When
     this is completed, the columns are treated similarly. The overall
     procedure amounts to two approximate traveling salesperson problems (TSP),
     one on the rows and one on the columns. The so-called `best insertion
     strategy' is used: rows (or columns) are inserted into the current
     permuted list of rows (or columns). Several consecutive runs of the
     algorithm might improve the energy.  

     Note that Arabie and Hubert (1990) question its use with non-binary data
     if the objective is to find a seriation or one-dimensional orderings of
     rows and columns. 

     The BEA code used in this package was implemented by Fionn Murtagh.
     
     In \code{control} as element \code{"rep"} the number of runs can be 
     specified. The results of the best run will be returned.
     }

\item{\code{"BEA_TSP"}}{Use a TSP to optimize the \bold{Measure of Effectiveness} 
    (Lenstra 1974). 
      
    In \code{control} as element \code{"method"} a TSP solver method can be
    specified (see package \pkg{TSP}).
    }

\item{\code{"PCA"}, \code{"PCA_angle"}}{ Principal component analysis.
      
      Uses the projection of the data on its first principal component to
      determine the order. 
      
      Note that for a distance matrix calculated from \code{x} with Euclidean
      distance, this methods minimizes the least square criterion.
      
      \code{"PCA_angle"} projects the data on the first two principal components
    and then orders by the angle in this space. The order
    is split by the larges gap between adjacent angles. A similar method was 
    used for ordering correlation matrices by Friendly (2002).
      
      }  

\item{\code{"Identity"}}{ Produces an identity permutation. }

\item{\code{"Random"}}{ Produces a random permutation. }
}

For array no built-in methods are currently available.
